## Group project report due to 28th November 2022

### R&D
Components: 
- Lorenzo Tarricone 
- Clémence Mottez
- Iris Burn 
- Nina Peuker

L.T. Produced the synthetic data needed for the group, Worked on the implementation of the adaptation of the algorithm for productig the Colocalization table, Divided the work for the components of the group.

Clémence Mottez: Research on the algorithm for the slide-seq and Cartana colocalization table to determined the formulas we will use. Documentation on the David data base and on some different libraries to open read and change CSV and TXT file. Start on working on a C++ program to do the first step of the colocalization table: Open, read and change all integers value in log,base2(value) given a txt file of the form of the matrix (cells time genes) 

Iris Brun: Start working on a c++ program to do a matrix with distances between all points given an array with the x and y coordinates of the cells. Also start doing a c++ code that given the matrix with the distances, computes the linkage value given an m and p. Research about the way to adapt the slide-seq data to the Cartana functions needed to produce the gene colocalization table. This work will continue next week.

### Algorithms/Backend 
Components:
- Jingai Si
- Samuel Tillier 
- Adrian Düsselberg
- Alan Picucci

Generated ssh key for all the team members for easy git access, researched on making scatter plot, looking into using gnuplot or implementing resourceful matplotlib C++ analogue library code from github, created small dataset for coordinate plot testing, generated simple plot using gnuplot.
Next week: Write the CMakeLists.txt file and install Apache Arrow as well as Xtensor (and any other libraries required)


### Frontend 
Components:
- Rita Saraiva
- Leonard Theisler

Rita Saraiva: Generated ssh key. Created a "dummy" project to experiment with the functionalities of the frontend such as buttons, and text boxes. Next week: assessing the needs of the project and starting to implement them (interacting with the user for uploading files) and find a solution for how to display the intended output.

Leonard Theisler: Generated ssh key. Created a new branch and set up a Qt widget application for the project (had issues with windows/mac build, added things to gitignore). Researched GUI libraries, we will be using Qt. Started familiarizing with the GUI library and made a basic button work. Next week: will try to make a basic program which allows the user to upload a file after clicking on a button.
