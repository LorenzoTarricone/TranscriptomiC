## Group project report due to 11th December 2022

Iris Brun: Researched a new method to obtain the values for the collocalization table and found an api that gives all the alternative names of a gene.

Clémence Mottez: Research on how works the API in C++

Iris Brun: Wrote a code that given an eigen matrix calculates an eigen matrix giving the distance between points and an eigen matrix giving the linkage values.

Clémence Mottez: wrote a program that will help the API searching for genes. In our project we will ask the researcher to give us as input some specific genes he wants us to study. However, the names he will give us might be different from the ones we have in our matrix table (cell times genes). Indeed, a same gene can have different names. Thus we need to find all the names of the different genes to look for all of these in order to select the data we want to keep. The program I wrote is to clear the data we will have after "calling the API". The API will give us some lines of data and we only want to keep some informations: the different names of the gene put as input.
Program: genename.cpp and genename.h: it takes the string of the answer of the API as input and the "search parameter"(=the gene we put at the end of the API search) and returns a string with the informations we need (=the other names of the gene "search parameter")
