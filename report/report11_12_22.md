## Group project report due to 11th December 2022

### R&D
Members: 
- Clémence Mottez
- Lorenzo Tarricone 
- Iris Brun

Iris Brun: Researched a new method to obtain the values for the collocalization table and found an api that gives all the alternative names of a gene.

Clémence Mottez: Research on how works the API in C++

### Algorithms/Backend

Iris Brun: Wrote a code that given an eigen matrix calculates an eigen matrix giving the distance between points and an eigen matrix giving the linkage values.

Clémence Mottez: wrote a program that will help the API searching for genes. In our project we will ask the researcher to give us as input some specific genes he wants us to study. However, the names he will give us might be different from the ones we have in our matrix table (cell times genes). Indeed, a same gene can have different names. Thus we need to find all the names of the different genes to look for all of these in order to select the data we want to keep. The program I wrote is to clear the data we will have after "calling the API". The API will give us some lines of data and we only want to keep some informations: the different names of the gene put as input.
Program: genename.cpp and genename.h: it takes the string of the answer of the API as input and the "search parameter"(=the gene we put at the end of the API search) and returns a string with the informations we need (=the other names of the gene "search parameter") 

Jingai Si: Created C00 class to easier function under C00 writing easier; wrote function and testing fuction for summing up normal matrix columns and sparse matrix columns for the gene expression matrix.

Adrian Düsselberg: did research on matplotlib and tried to implement it in the project. It is very useful for plotting data in C++ ; worked on the sparse matrix representation.

Nina Peuker: API setup and dummy code for sending queries to the database and recover gene names and symbols.

### Frontend 
Members:
- Rita Saraiva
- Leonard Theisler

Leonard Theisler: Changed the organization of the frontend code and made it more object oriented. Implemented classes and functions to compartmentalize the different tasks of the code. Created a new branch on the repository with the qcustomplot library. Did a lot of debugging to find out why the program could not plot data read from a file. Identified the issue and solved it, the program can now plot data after reading it from a csv file. Researched design principles for GUI and discussed how we would like the GUI to look.

Rita Saraiva: Changed the upload window. It now has two buttons. The "select" button opens the file explorer on the computer and allows the user to choose the file they would like to upload. The file location then appears in the textbox (and can be changed by the user) and the "upload" button uploads the file. Edited the style of the buttons for consistency. Researched design principles for GUI, discussed how the GUI should look and sketched an initial idea of how the end product will look.
