Jingai Si; Samuel Tillier; Adrian Düsselberg: Testing out the QCustomPlots library, which allows the generation of plots (including heat maps) within the Qt interface using widgets. We are currently working on the implementation of QCustomPlots into our main project, but the project may have to be reconfigured differently for this to work. Determined the calculation of the matrix column sum for gene expression, which will give a value corresponding to the intensity on the heat map. We are currently optimising this calculation based on its complexity. Conducted research on sparse matrices and their representations as arrays with zero entries excluded.


### Frontend 
Members:
- Rita Saraiva
- Leonard Theisler

Leonard Theisler: Wrote a script that takes user input and opens the file. User writes the file location in a text editor in the GUI, a window pops up if the file is not found and if it is found it reads it. Also managed to print the data in a popup window, how ever it prints data point by datapoint. Investigated QCustomPlots library and attempted to add it to the project, came to the same conclusion as the backend team.

Rita Saraiva: Researched and implemented how to make new windows open. Wrote a script where the main window closes upon successful file upload and a new main window appears.
