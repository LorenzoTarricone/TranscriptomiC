Jingai Si; Samuel Tillier; Adrian Düsselberg: Testing out the QCustomPlots library, which allows the generation of plots (including heat maps) within the Qt interface using widgets. We are currently working on the implementation of QCustomPlots into our main project, but the project may have to be reconfigured differently for this to work. Determined the calculation of the matrix column sum for gene expression, which will give a value corresponding to the intensity on the heat map. We are currently optimising this calculation based on its complexity. Conducted research on sparse matrices and their representations as arrays with zero entries excluded.
