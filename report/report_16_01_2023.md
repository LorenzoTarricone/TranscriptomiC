Clémence Mottez: I finally found a data base that given a biological process gives a list of gene. However it is not ideal since we can’t call an URL to have access to it. I will continue to try to find another solution but from now I will work with that since I already spent a lot of time and didn’t find nothing better. But it is still something. If we can’t find anything better we will just ask the researcher to go on this website, log in and download the table associated to the biological process he wants to analyse.

Clémence Mottez: This week I worked on the biological processes implementation since it is nearly the deadline and that we have nothing implemented. 
First part: given a list of gene, find the biological process linked to it: First I wrote a code that gives the following information: nb in list, id and label from the string given by the API (in the same class as only_gene_name since it uses the same functions). 
Second part: given a biological process find a list of genes associated to it. First, I wrote a new function in readgenetxt that will read the txt file that the researcher will upload, and only select the first x genes (x is a parameter, I think it will be around 500, the « first » x is because they are sort by order: the most expressed are the first in list). I created a new class read.tsv that read the gene.tsv file (one of the 3 files the research inputs, it contains all the genes expressed in the tissu we are studying), and store them in a set. I created a new class intersection_sets that return the intersection of 2 sets of strings. I also prepare the code that we will finally use with the API in main… function (for gene name from last week + biological process from this week), since we will need to combine everything as soon as possible. The API will work like that: read .tsv file, stores all gene names in a set, then read .txt file, store in a vector, then call the API on this vector to create a set with all the possible names of the genes, and then take the intersection of the 2 sets (so that we only keep the one we are interested in). I also added this functionality (take intersection of sets) to the last week API since it will be more efficient. Finally, in order to manage the heap memory, I deleted the pointers no longer useful (for example the vectors and the sets we used, I only keept the intersection set, the one the code returns.
