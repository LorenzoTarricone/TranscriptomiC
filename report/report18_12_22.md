Leonard Theisler: Took up partial project management role. Became Trello leader. Created a Trello instructions document. Fixed small bug on file upload. Updated the repository to respect continuous integration. Created 2 new windows in the GUI (accessible from the second window) for colocalization and biological process analysis. Created colocalizationwindow and bioprocesswindow classes. Merged the heatmap into the frontend. Modified the heatmap to use data from the file, however the heatmap output seems wrong.

Rita Saraiva: Attempted to create the possibility to switch between windows at will, giving the user the possibility to upload a new file. Struggled with redudancy and invested time in researching mulitple possible solution.
