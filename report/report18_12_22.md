## Group project report due to 18th December 2022

### R&D Database
Members: 
- Clémence Mottez
- Lorenzo Tarricone 
- Iris Brun
- Nicolás López Corral
- Jingai Si

Iris Brun: correct the file that gives the collocalization matrix in eigen form given the cells and genes matrices.

Clémence Mottez: wrote a program that, given a txt file with a list of genes (separated by spaces, tabs, lines, ... whatever), store the gene names in a vector of strings (program named "readgenetxt.cpp .h"). I also changed my program from last week to store the result we are interested in (the previous, current and other names of the gene of the API call) in a set and return that set. Start to write a code that combine everything (read txt file, use API on a specific gene and return a big set with all the different names of all the different genes in the txt file), without the code that do the API call from now, since we didn't managed to do it yet.

Jingai Si: Researched the algorithm to determine the correlation between gene expression in colocalization table, read trough current related nature paper and generated a summary about Spatial transcriptomics at subspot resolution with BayesSpace.

Nicolás: Wrote a function to interact with the HGNC API, using Qt Network. Working on an error caused by the OpenSSL library on my machine.

### Algorithms/Backend 
Members:
- Samuel Tillier 
- Adrian Düsselberg
- Nina Peuker
- Alan Picucci


Adrian Düsselberg: Created a new branch "Heat Map Optimazation without Eigen" and worked on the heatmap. Also tried to find a more optimal approch to create the heatmap (vectors for data instead of cell by cell).  


### Frontend 
Members:
- Rita Saraiva
- Leonard Theisler

Leonard Theisler: Took up partial project management role. Became Trello leader. Created a Trello instructions document. Fixed small bug on file upload. Updated the repository to respect continuous integration. Created 2 new windows in the GUI (accessible from the second window) for colocalization and biological process analysis. Created colocalizationwindow and bioprocesswindow classes. Merged the heatmap into the frontend. Modified the heatmap to use data from the file, however the heatmap output seems wrong.

Rita Saraiva: Attempted to create the possibility to switch between windows at will, giving the user the possibility to upload a new file. Struggled with redudancy and invested time in researching mulitple possible solution.
