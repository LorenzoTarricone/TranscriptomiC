1 CSV: name Matrix
Column: beams/cells 
Rows: genes 
Only numbers in the matrix 
The majority is 0 since 99,18% of sparcity, but we can have mistakes

Size: around 23500 genes and 15000 cells

2nd CSV: name loction
Column: beams/cells 
Rows: x and y (only 2 rows) 

Normally cells from both CSV tables are in the same order (need to check)

We can have several cells on one beams, since the size of the cell is smaller than the size of a beam 
But for the majority of beams, it is not the case (1 beam = 1 cell)
