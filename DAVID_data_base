# DAVID data base #

= The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery 
It provides a set of functional annotation tools to understand the biological meaning behind large lists of genes. 
DAVID tools are able to:

1/Should be important for us:
- Identify enriched biological themes, particularly GO terms
- Discover enriched functional-related gene groups
- Cluster redundant annotation terms
- Visualize genes on BioCarta & KEGG pathway maps
- Display related many-genes-to-many-terms on 2-D view.
- Search for other functionally related genes not in the list
- Explore gene names in batch
 
 2/ Might be useful too 
- List interacting proteins
- Link gene-disease associations
- Highlight protein functional domains and motifs
- Convert gene identifiers from one type to another.


How does it work?


https://david.ncifcrf.gov/api.jsp?type=xxxxx&ids=XXXXX,XXXXX,XXXXXX,&tool=xxxx&annot=xxxxx,xxxxxx,xxxxx,

type  =  one of DAVID recognized gene types
annot  = a list of desired annotation  categories separated by ","
ids  = a list of user's gene IDs separated by ","
tool  = one of DAVID tool names
