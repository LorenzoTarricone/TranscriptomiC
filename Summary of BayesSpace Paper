Spatial transcriptomics at subspot resolution with BayesSpace

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00935-2

- Introduce BayesSpace, a fully Bayesian statistical method that uses the information from spatial neighborhoods for resolution enhancement 
of spatial transcriptomic data and for clustering analysis.

- BayesSpace enhanced-resolution clustering can increase the resolution of data that were simulated from real, aggregated single cells.

- BayesSpace enhanced-resolution clustering outperformed the optimal clustering that can be achieved at the spot level in melanoma and 
ovarian samples that were simulated at the subspot level.

- Data modelling: 
 $$\left( {y_i{\mathrm{|}}z_i = k,w_i} \right) \sim N\left( {y_i;\mu _k,w_i^{ - 1}{\Lambda}^{ - 1}} \right), z_i \in \left\{ {1, \ldots ,q} \right\}$$
denotes the latent cluster that i belongs to, μk denotes the mean vector for cluster k, Λ denotes the precision matrix, and wi denotes an unknown (observation-spec
ific) scaling factor.

- Assume a common (fixed) precision matrix across clusters because the number of unknown parameters in the precision matrix quickly rises with higher numbers of 
clusters and numbers of PCs modeled.

- Assume that the common precision matrix is unconstrained as there is correlation between PCs after conditioning on cluster, even though PCs are marginally 
uncorrelated.

- The variable precision model often required strong priors for parameter estimation.

- The number of clusters q is determined by prior biological knowledge when available or otherwise by the elbow of the pseudo-log-likelihood plot.

- Place the following priors on μk, Λ and wi, 
 $$\begin{array}{l}\mu _k\mathop{\sim}\limits^{\textrm{i.i.d.}} N\left( {\mu _0,{\Lambda}_0^{ - 1}} \right),\\ {\Lambda}\mathop{\sim}\limits^{{\textrm{i.i.d.}}}\textrm{Wishart}_d\left( {\alpha ,{\textrm{diag}}\left( \beta \right)_d^{ - 1}} \right),\\ w_i\mathop{\sim}\limits^{\textrm{i.i.d.}}\Gamma\left( {\frac{\nu }{2},\frac{\nu }{2}} \right),\end{array}  $$,
where μ0, Λ0, α and β are fixed hyperparameters. By default, we set μ0 to be the empirical mean vector of the data.
