The Wasserstein distance has its roots in forming a metric between two probability measures. 

Sliced-Wasserstein distance has significantly lower computational requirements than the classical Wasserstein distance.

- One-dimensional distributions: The case of one-dimensional continuous probability measures is specifically interesting as 
the p-Wasserstein distance has a closed-form solution. More precisely, for one-dimensional probability measures, there exists 
a unique monotonically increasing transport map that pushes one measure to another.

- $$\[W_{p}(\mu, \nu)=\left(\inf _{\gamma \in \Gamma(\mu, \nu)} \int_{X \times Y} d^{p}(x, y) d \gamma(x, y)\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}\]$$
