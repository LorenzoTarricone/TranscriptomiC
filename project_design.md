# Project Design 

## Groups:
Even though there are no fixed groups, people will work on three main different aspects of the project. The three different teams are the following:

- 4 people in the **R&D team**: these people should be interested in mathematical modelling and biology. Big part of their work will be to research the available literature, adapt the methods and ideas found to our project and produce some “proof of work code” that if promising will be later implemented.
- 4 people in the **Backend/Algorithm Optimisation team**: these people should be relatively strong coders passionate about efficient memory/computational resources allocation and cloud computing. They will have the hard job to implement in an efficient way the ideas produced by the R&D team.
- 1 person in the **Database and API team**: this person will be also part of the Backend/ Algorithm Optimisation team, but in particular they will have the to figure out how to let our platform interact with some existing databases to retrieve some information needed for the analysis.
- 2 people in the **Frontend team**: as the name suggests, these people should be creatives and passionate about graphic design.They will work on the platform UX and general aesthetic. We want this to be an intuitive tool that any scientist without a coding background should be able to use.

## Key Roles:
- **Project Leader**: Lorenzo Tarricone
- **Git Leader**: 
- **Board Leader**:

## Description:
The pipeline follows more or less described in the README.md file
