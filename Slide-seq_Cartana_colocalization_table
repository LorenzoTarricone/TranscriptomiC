Colocalization of the genes:
Probability to have this particular gene near this gene

Given a n times k matrix, n nb of genes, k nb of beads 
Matrix, nb of genes times nb of genes 

1/ Build the distance matrix (sqrt((x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2))

2/ Build linkage score Lij= (max(0,m-Bij)/m)^p *100
   Lij : linkage between bead i and j
   Bij : the distance
   m : maximum interprete distance (50microm or ask the researcher)
   p : parameter (determines decay of linkage)
   put 0 if distance greater than m
   
3/ Apply linkage to gene by bread matrix 
Do vectors: 
Nj (for each columns) : sum (r=1,...k) without j of: (Ar (original table n x k) times Ljr 
output: n times k matrix indication average gene expression in neihboring beans 

4/ Combine original table with gene expression table 
3D matrix
Di= Aj . Nj(transpose)
result : nb of genes times nb of genes times nb of beads 

5/log normalization of D
Dr,i,j=log(Drij/mean(Dri)+0.1)

6/ Average over k to have a n times n table
